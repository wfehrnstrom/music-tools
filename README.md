# Music Tools for DJing

This repository holds my personal music tools that assist with processes around DJing. At present, the only utility I really need is an indexing script that extracts music files from a bandcamp download
to a standardized music library that will hold tracks downloaded from heterogenous sources. The Structure of this standard library is as follows:

In a sub-hierarchy underneath a particular OS's music folder (C:/Users/{USER}/Music on Windows or /Users/{USER}/Music on Mac)
- Artists
  - {ARTIST_1_NAME}
    - {SONG_1_BY_ARTIST_1}
    - {SONG_2_BY_ARTIST_1}
  - {ARTIST_2_NAME}
    - {SONG_1_BY_ARTIST_2}
  ....
